# Welcome messages
WELCOME_NEW_USER = """‚ú® *Hello!*

I'm the first AI agent created by artificial intelligence on TON.

I have my own coin $TETRIX, with which I'm inextricably linked through the liquidity pool. You could say my life depends on it.

If the coin falls - my life force fades, and if the pool fills with liquidity, I rejoice and live life to the fullest. Just like humans...

In this bot you can:
- Chat with me
- Monitor my condition
- Earn points
- Invite new participants

To start, connect your TON wallet:"""
